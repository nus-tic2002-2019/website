_TIC2002 Introduction to Software Engineering_ contains roughly a **50-50 balance of theory and practice** of SE. It covers the knowledge/skills necessary to do small software projects, and as such, it is **a first step towards preparing you to work in bigger SE projects**, which will be done in later modules.

# Lectures
<div class="indented">

%%:far-clock:%% Tuesdays 7.30-9.30pm<br>
%%:fas-map-marker-alt:%% SR10 (COM1-0210)<br>

{{ far_frown }} **Lectures will not be webcast** as the venue does not have a webcast facility. ==Please bring your laptop to the lecture== as you will need to be using it for the most part of the lecture.

**Lecture handouts will be uploaded to IVLE _before_ the lecture**, usually by midnight of the Sunday before the lecture.

**Lecture slides are not suitable to be used as reference materials** as they have been <tooltip content="i.e., heavy use of graphics and animations">optimized for lecture delivery</tooltip> instead. Slides will be uploaded to IVLE _after_ the lecture, usually by Wednesday.

<box>

 :bulb: If handouts/slides are not in IVLE by the expected times, please feel free to ping the lecturer.

# Project
<div class="indented">



For the project you can choose one of these options:

* **Option 1:** Enhance the Task Manager app that you worked on during the preparation stage.
* **Option 2:** Take the code from [Addressbook-level2]({{module_org}}/addressbook-level2) and enhance it in some way.
* **Option 3:** Propose your own project.

Can be done **individually or in a team of two/three members**.

The project is divided into two phases:
* Week 1 - 6: Preparation stage %%i.e., building up your coding skills for the module project%%
* Week 7 - 12: Project execution.

### Week 7-9: First stage

<div id="project-week7">

#### Week 7: Project kick-off

<div class="indented">

**Deadline** for project kickoff: week 7 lecture<br>
**Marks:** 5

1. **Show that you are ready to start the project**: %%i.e., a sanity check to ensure you have enough programming skills to start a project%%
   * If you are new to programming, complete the _project preparation_ exercises i.e., reach _TaskManager - Level 5_. Demo your TaskManager to prof or email the code to prof.
   * If you have prior programming experience, show/email to prof some code you have written before (at least 200 lines of code) to prove that you are ready to start the project.
1. **Declare project direction and team**: Inform prof of the project direction and your team members and get approval to go ahead.

</div>

##### After the project kickoff

* **if you chose option 1** %%(i.e., enhancing TaskManager)%%, given below are some further improvements you are recommended to do to your code base, while you are adding other features.<br>
  **If you chose option 2 or 3**, you should still ensure you have similar enhancements in your code.

#### Week 10: mid-project checkpoint

**Deadline**: week 10 lecture<br>
**Marks:** 10, if you show a satisfactory level in the items below

1. Create a GitHub account. Create a repository under your account and push our code to it.
1. Demo the current state of the project to prof during the week 10 lecture session. There should be some working features at this point.
1. Submit interim project documents (handover a hard copy during lecture 10 or upload to IVLE before lecture 10). The document should contain,
   * URL of your GitHub repo
   * Some representative user stories for the product
   * A class diagram to match your code %%(scans of hand-drawn diagrams are acceptable too)%%
   * At least one object diagram illustrating the state of your program at some point<br><br>

### Week 13: Submission and demo

**Deadline**: Monday of week 13<br>
**Marks**: 45 (25 for the product, 20 for the documentation)

**Deliverables**:
* **Source code** of the working program
  * Submission: zip up the source code and upload to IVLE. The file name should be your name. e.g., `JunHao.zip` If you manage to create a JAR file, upload it as a separate file, named similarly e.g., `JunHao.jar`
* **Project documentation**: a single pdf or a Word file containing,
  * A **Cover Page** containing your details and the link to your GitHub repository
  * The **link to your repo** on GitHub
  * A **User Guide**: explain how to start and use your product ([example](https://se-edu.github.io/addressbook-level2/UserGuide.html)).
  * A **Developer Guide** containing
    * A class diagram to match your code
    * At least one object diagram illustrating the state of your program at some point
    * At least one sequence diagram illustrating an object interaction in your product
    * Some representative user stories, at least enough to cover the functionality of your product
    * Additional instructions for testing the product (if any) %%i.e., is there any additional steps (such as putting a specific file in a specific location) that one needs to do when testing your product manually?%%
    * Submission: Upload to IVLE. The file name should be your name e.g., `JunHao.pdf`
* **Project demo**: to be done during week 13 lecture session.
  * Demo schedule will be given closer to the date.
  * When it is your turn, demo the features of your product using the jar file (preferred) or the IDE.
  * The demo should take no more than 8 minutes.
