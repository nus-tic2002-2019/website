_TIC2002 Introduction to Software Engineering_ contains roughly a **50-50 balance of theory and practice** of SE. It covers the knowledge/skills necessary to do small software projects, and as such, it is **a first step towards preparing you to work in bigger SE projects**, which will be done in later modules.

# Lectures
<div class="indented">

%%:far-clock:%% Tuesdays 7.30-9.30pm<br>
%%:fas-map-marker-alt:%% SR2 (COM1-02-04)<br>

{{ far_frown }} **Lectures will not be webcast** as the venue does not have a webcast facility. ==Please bring your laptop to the lecture== as you will need to be using it for the most part of the lecture.

**Lecture slides are not suitable to be used as reference materials** as they have been <tooltip content="i.e., heavy use of graphics and animations">optimized for lecture delivery</tooltip> instead. Slides will be uploaded to LumiNUS _after_ the lecture, usually by Wednesday.

{{ icon_tip }} If slides are not in LumiNUS by the expected times, please feel free to ping the lecturer.

# Programming language
<div class="indented">

This module uses Java. It assumes you are familiar with C++ basics and provides lessons to help you transition from C++ to Java.

{{ icon_important_big_red }} Install [JDK 11](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk11-downloads-5066655.html) in your computer.

# Project
<div class="indented">

* The project is to be done **individually**.
* In the project, you will build a small chatbot, using Java.
* The project is to be done in small increments. You will be given a schedule of what increments to be done in each week.
* Some weekly increments will be common to all students, while some will vary from student to student. That means your final product will be unique in terms of total features, but some features will be common to other students in the class.

### Week 7-9: First stage

<div id="project-week7">

#### Week 7: Project kick-off

<div class="indented">

**Deadline** for project kickoff: week 7 lecture<br>
**Marks:** 5

1. **Show that you are ready to start the project**: %%i.e., a sanity check to ensure you have enough programming skills to start a project%%
   * If you are new to programming, complete the _project preparation_ exercises i.e., reach _TaskManager - Level 5_. Demo your TaskManager to prof or email the code to prof.
   * If you have prior programming experience, show/email to prof some code you have written before (at least 200 lines of code) to prove that you are ready to start the project.
1. **Declare project direction and team**: Inform prof of the project direction and your team members and get approval to go ahead.

</div>

##### After the project kickoff

* **if you chose option 1** %%(i.e., enhancing TaskManager)%%, given below are some further improvements you are recommended to do to your code base, while you are adding other features.<br>
  **If you chose option 2 or 3**, you should still ensure you have similar enhancements in your code.

1. Demo the current state of the project to prof during the week 10 lecture session. There should be some working features at this point.
1. Submit interim project documents (handover a hard copy during lecture 10 or upload to LumiNUS before lecture 10). The document should contain,
   * URL of your GitHub repo
   * Some representative user stories for the product
   * A class diagram to match your code %%(scans of hand-drawn diagrams are acceptable too)%%
   * At least one object diagram illustrating the state of your program at some point<br><br>

  * A **Cover Page** containing your details and the link to your GitHub repository
  * The **link to your repo** on GitHub
  * A **User Guide**: explain how to start and use your product ([example](https://se-edu.github.io/addressbook-level2/UserGuide.html)).
  * A **Developer Guide** containing
    * A class diagram to match your code
    * At least one object diagram illustrating the state of your program at some point
    * At least one sequence diagram illustrating an object interaction in your product
    * Some representative user stories, at least enough to cover the functionality of your product
    * Additional instructions for testing the product (if any) %%i.e., is there any additional steps (such as putting a specific file in a specific location) that one needs to do when testing your product manually?%%
    * Submission: Upload to LumiNUS. The file name should be your name e.g., `JunHao.pdf`
* **Project demo**: to be done during week 13 lecture session.
  * Demo schedule will be given closer to the date.
  * When it is your turn, demo the features of your product using the jar file (preferred) or the IDE.
