**Preparation**:

* Create a new repo with the name given below in your personal GitHub account. Remember to enable the issue tracker:<br>
  -- for PE Dry Run (at **v1.3**): `pe-d`<br>
  -- for PE (at **v1.4**): `pe`
  * Ensure that you have accepted the invitation to join the GitHub org used by the module. Go to [https://github.com/orgs/nus-{{ module | lower }}-{{ semester }}/invitation](https://github.com/orgs/nus-{{ module | lower }}-{{ semester }}/invitation) to accept the invitation.
  * If you cannot find the invitation, post in our [forum]({{ forum_link }}).

* Ensure you have access to a **computer that is able to run module projects** %%e.g. has the right Java version%%.

* Download the CATcher (link to be given nearer to the date) and ensure you can run it on your computer.

* **Have a good screen grab tool** with annotation features so that you can quickly take a screenshot of a bug, annotate it, and post in the issue tracker.
  * {{ icon_tip }} You can use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> to paste a picture from the clipboard into a text box in bug report.

* **Charge your computer** before coming to the PE session. The testing venue may not have enough charging points.
