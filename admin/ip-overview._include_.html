      <p>The objective of the individual project (iP):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Refresh programming skills you learned in CS2030</li>
        <li>Learn some skills required for the team project</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All skills you will learn when doing the iP will be useful in the team project (tP). Furthermore, some of the code you will write in iP can be adapted for the tP.</p>
      <p>The iP is based on the generic project <a href="/website/se-book-adapted/projectDuke/index.html"><em>Project Duke</em></a>, the overview of which is given below.</p>
